Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task. Ansible is an open-source automation tool developed by Redhat that is meant for simplifying the configuration management, application deployment, and automation of tasks.

Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks. 

In Ansible, an inventory is a file with specifying the information of hosts that going to be managed. It contains information such as hostnames, IP addresses, and groups of organization.

Ansible is built on top of Python.

Handlers in Ansible are tasks that are triggered by other tasks, usually used to respond for the changes that require start , stop , reload or restart the service actions. They are defined in the playbook and executed as per need.
